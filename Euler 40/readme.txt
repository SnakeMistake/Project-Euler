An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:
0.12345678910112131415161718192021....
It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.
If d_n represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.
d_1 x d_10 x d_100 x d_1000 x d_10000 x d_100000 x d_1000000
