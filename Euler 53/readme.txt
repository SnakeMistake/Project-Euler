There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, (5pick3) = 10.
In general, (npickr) = {n!}/{r!(n-r)!}, where r <= n, n! = n x (n-1) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1, and 0! = 1.

It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: (23pick10) = 1144066.
How many, not necessarily distinct, values of (npickr) for 1 <= n <= 100, are greater than one-million?
